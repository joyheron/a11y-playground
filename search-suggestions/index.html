			<h1>Providing accessible search suggestions</h1>

			<ins datetime="2022-09-02T10:25">
				<strong>Update:</strong>
				The component has been modified after the first tests and some feedback
				has been incorporated. The newest version of this component attempts to
				implement <a href="#test2-changes">three new ideas</a>.
			</ins>

			<p>
				This is a test to attempt to discover how to accessibly provide search
				suggestions for a search widget that can be included in any page within
				the website to allow users to search through content available on the
				site.
			</p>
			<p>
				This widget is not a dedicated search page, but instead will accept user
				input and redirect the users to
				<a href="./results.html">the dedicated search page</a> to show the results.
			</p>
			<p>
				The test here is to determine how to accessibly provide autocomplete
				suggestions for the user. The main goal of the test is to improve the
				accessibility of the
				<a href="https://github.com/innoq/simplete">simplete</a>
				component, since that currently has some accessibility problems.
			</p>
			<h2>Test Goals</h2>
			<p>
				For the widget, we want to ensure the following:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Assistive technologies announce that there are autocomplete options
					available.
				</li>
				<li>
					When users cycle through the available options, these should be
					announced to the user.
				</li>
				<li>
					The options which are provided within the list of autocomplete
					selections should only be accessible via the arrow keys and not
					be accessible via the Tab-key.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Additionally, we want also want to improve the user-experience for
				the widget as much as possible. Selecting an autocomplete suggestion
				should result in the same behavior as typing a user defined search
				string and executing the form would result in. In our case, we redirect
				to the results page in both cases.
			</p>
			<h2>Further Test Goals</h2>
			<p>
				In the first test, we were able to achieve the aforementioned goals.
				After some feedback, the current version includes the following changes:
			</p>
			<ol id="test2-changes">
				<li>
					An <code>aria-live</code> region has been added to the widget to
					announce to assistive technologies how many search suggestions are
					available. <strong>Note:</strong> we want the widget to be able to
					support this, but this is a feature that we will need to test with
					users. It may not always be useful.
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The list of suggestions now includes a label on the <code>ul</code>
						element, which results in the list and the number of suggestions
						being announced as a list in NVDA.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>I still have the following open question:</strong>
						In my tests with NVDA this still does not result in announcing
						which element within the list is currently selected. I'm not sure
						if that is because of my NVDA settings. The elements are semantic
						<code>li</code> elements, but they also have the
						<code>role=option</code> set, so I'm not sure if that would
						override the list semantics for assistive technologies.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					I've updated the input field to use the <code>combobox=role</code>.
					I originally left this out (see
					<a href="#combobox-question">my open question about combobox</a>),
					but according to the
					<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/">
						WAI ARIA Authoring Practices Guide for Combobox
					</a> a search field is used as an example for when a combobox can
					be used to accept arbitrary values but suggest possible values
					to the user.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="combobox-question">Open Question about combobox</h2>
			<p>
				One question that I currently have is whether or not the search field
				should have a
				<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/combobox_role">
					combobox role
				</a>.
				The autocomplete here is intended to provide <em>possible</em> solutions,
				but will not always provide all of the possible solutions. I'm unclear
				whether it is expected that all valid possiblities for the combobox are
				provided in the listbox of solutions. That would definitely not be the
				case here.
			</p>
			<p>
				For now, the search field receives the <code>aria-haspopup=listbox</code>
				and <code>aria-autocomplete=list</code> roles, and I would like to test
				if this is sufficient, or if it should really be designated as a combobox
				for assistive technologies.
			</p>
			<h2>How to test the widget</h2>
			<p>
				The search widget can be tested in the <a href="#header">header</a>
				of the page.
			</p>
			<p>
				An alternate solution which has been used as a reference for the
				autocomplete implementation is
				<a href="https://projects.verou.me/awesomplete/">awesomplete</a>.
				The reason to prefer to use
				<a href="https://github.com/innoq/simplete">simplete</a> would be
				because it supports the generation of the search suggestions
				dynamically on the server.
