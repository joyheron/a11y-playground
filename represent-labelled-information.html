    <h1>Representing Labelled Information</h1>

    <nav aria-labelledby="toc-label">
      <span id="toc-label" aria-hidden="true">Table of Contents</span>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#description-list">Description List</a></li>
        <li><a href="#unordered-list">An unordered list</a></li>
        <li><a href="#no-list-at-all">No list at all (group)</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>

    Here I am testing out different ways to displayed labelled information.
    The main issue that I need to solve here is to make sure that any label is
    clearly associated with its value and ideally the other way around as well.

    <section>
      <h2 id="description-list">Description List</h2>

      <p>
        A description list seems like the HTML structure which you would automatically reach
        for when implementing this use case, because its intention is list out a term followed
        by the definition which is associated with it.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, the description list's HTML structure is sometimes not ideal,
        because we are not allowed to add any elements around the <code>dt</code> and <code>dd</code> tags
        in the HTML.
        This limits the amount of visual style that is possible with CSS
        (e.g. it isn't possible to easily show the label / value pairs next to each other in the UI),
        so it isn't ideal for all circumstances.
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Discount</dt>
        <dd>9%</dd>
        <dt>Price</dt>
        <dd>$14.00</dd>
      </dl>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id="unordered-list">An unordered list</h2>

      <p>
        This attempts to rectify the shortcomings of the definition list by inserting the label and value
        pairs as a single list entry.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, this only groups them together in the UI within a list, but doesn't actually semantically
        link the label with its value.
        Also, it would be easy to argue that the list context in this example is superfluous,
        since the labelled information here isn't really a list.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Discount: 9%</li>
        <li>Price: $14.00</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id="no-list-at-all">No list at all (group)</h2>

      <p>
        This uses the <code>group</code> attribute to group related information together.
        I like this method because it semantically identifies the label and its value.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here, we are using the <code>aria-labelledby</code> attribute to generate the label
        for the group and hiding the actual label with the <code>aria-hidden</code> attribute.
        We can hide the label because its value is already read out by the screenreader.
        If the group is duplicated on the page (and the label is therefore also duplicated),
        we need to make sure that we generate a unique id for the label element OR use
        <code>aria-label</code> instead.
      </p>

      <div class="group" aria-labelledby="discountGenUniqueId">
        <div id="discountGenUniqueId">Discount</div>
        <div>9%</div>
      </div>

      <div class="group" aria-labelledby="priceGenUniqueId">
        <div id="priceGenUniqueId">Price</div>
        <div>$14.00</div>
      </div>
    </section>
  </body>
