					<strong>Update September 2, 2022 at 9:15 a.m.:</strong>
					The component has been modified after the first tests and some feedback
					has been incorporated. The second version of this component attempts to
					implement <a href="#test2-changes">three new ideas</a>.
				</ins>
			</p>

			<p>
				This is a series of tests to discover how to accessibly provide search
				suggestions for a search widget that can be included in any page within
				the website to allow users to search through content available on the
				site.
			</p>
			<p>
				This widget is not a dedicated search page, but instead will accept user
				input and redirect the users to
				<a href="./results.html">the dedicated search page</a> to show the results.
			</p>
			<p>
				The test here is to determine how to accessibly provide autocomplete
				suggestions for the user. The main goal of the test is to improve the
				accessibility of the
				<a href="https://github.com/innoq/simplete">simplete</a>
				component, since that currently has some accessibility problems.
			</p>
			<h2>Test Goals - Iteration 1</h2>
			<p>
				In the first iteration of the tests, we ensured that the following
				goals were achieved.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Assistive technologies announce that there are autocomplete options
					available when the focus is within the search field.
				</li>
				<li>
					When users cycle through the available options, these are announced
					to the user.
				</li>
				<li>
					The options which are provided within the list of autocomplete
					selections are only accessible via the arrow keys and not
					reachable via the Tab-key.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Additionally, we want also want to improve the user-experience for
				the widget as much as possible. Selecting an autocomplete suggestion
				should result in the same behavior as typing a user defined search
				string and executing the form would result in. In our case, we redirect
				to the results page in both cases.
			</p>
			<h2>Test Goals - Iteration 2</h2>
			<p>
				In the first test, we were able to achieve the aforementioned goals.
				After some feedback, the second version includes the following changes:
			</p>
			<ol id="test2-changes">
				<li>
					The widget should announce the number of search suggestions available
					to assistive technologies. For this, an <code>aria-live</code> region
					will be needed.
					<strong>Note:</strong> we want the widget to be able to
					support this, but this is a feature that we will need to test with
					users. It may not always be useful.
				</li>
				<li>
					The list of suggestions should be announced as a list in NVDA.
					This goal was achieved by adding a label to the <code>ul</code>
					element, without which the list information was not correctly
					announced in NVDA.
				</li>
				<li>
					The input field should use the <code>combobox=role</code>.
					See
					<a href="#combobox-question">the question about combobox</a>
					for more details.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>Test Goals - Iteration 3</h2>
			<p>
				Here are the goals that we want to accomplish in the third iteration
				of our test:
			</p>
			<ol id="test3-changes">
				<li>
					It should always be possible to revert from a search suggestion
					back to the original query by continuing to type. When the suggestion
					box opens and the user cycles through the available options, the user
					may decide that none of the options are relevant and want to continue
					typing to complete the original search query.
				</li>
				<li>
					One finding in the test was that it was sometimes possible that the
					text element used to announce the number of search suggestions was
					still read out when navigating from the search field to the search
					button in NVDA. I believe this occured when navigating in browse
					mode because the <code>aria-live</code> was still available as a
					text node even when the focus left the search field. This has been
					fixed so that the <code>aria-live</code> region is only active
					when the focus is the search field.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="combobox-question">Question about combobox role</h2>
			<p>
				One question is whether or not the search field should have a
				<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/combobox_role">
					combobox role
				</a>.
				The autocomplete here is intended to provide <em>possible</em> solutions,
				but will not always provide all of the possible solutions.
				I was originally unclear if a combobox was the correct role, because for
				use case, we make no promises about providing all valid possibilities
				for the search field. However, because the
				<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/">
					WAI ARIA Authoring Practices Guide for Combobox
				</a> explicitly uses a search field as an example for a combobox which
				provides some possible suggestions for the user but allows any content,
				I've decided to use the <code>combobox</code> role for now.
			</p>
			<p>
				An alternative solution would be to use the
				<code>aria-haspopup=listbox</code> role instead.
			</p>
			<h2>How to test the widget</h2>
			<p>
				The search widget can be tested in the <a href="#header">header</a>
				of the page.
			</p>
			<p>
				An alternate solution which has been used as a reference for the
				autocomplete implementation is
				<a href="https://projects.verou.me/awesomplete/">awesomplete</a>.
				The reason to prefer to use
				<a href="https://github.com/innoq/simplete">simplete</a> would be
				because it supports the generation of the search suggestions
				dynamically on the server.
